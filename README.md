# transit-cljd

Transit is a data format and set of libraries for conveying values between
applications written in different languages. This library provides support for
marshalling Transit data to/from ClojureDart.

* [Transit Rationale](https://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit)
* [Transit Specification](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)
* [transit-cljd API docs] coming soon

This implementation's major.minor version number corresponds to the version of
the Transit specification it supports.

_NOTE: Transit is intended primarily as a wire protocol for transferring data
between applications. If storing Transit data durably, readers and writers are
expected to use the same version of Transit and you are responsible for
migrating/transforming/re-storing that data when and if the transit format
changes._

## Usage

```
(ns main
  (:require ["dart:async" :as async]
            [wevre.transit-cljd :as transit]
            ["package:transit_dart/transit_dart.dart" :as td]))

(defrecord Point [x y])

(def point-write-handler (reify :extends #/(td/WriteHandler Point dynamic)
                           (tag [_ l] "point")
                           (rep [_ obj .tag] [(:x obj) (:y obj)])))

(def point-read-handler (reify :extends #/(td/ReadHandler Point dynamic)
                          (fromRep [_ o] (->Point (first o) (second o)))))

(defn main []
  (let [codec (transit/json :custom-read-handlers {"point" point-read-handler}
                            :custom-write-handlers {(#/(td/Class Point)) point-write-handler})
        objects ["foo" :bar {:a [1 2]}
                 #inst "2023-11-03T14:23:51.010-00:00"
                 (->Point 1.2 3.4)]
        _ (println "Object: " objects)
        encoded (await
                 (-> (async/Stream.fromIterable objects)
                     (.transform (.-encoder codec))
                     .toList))
        _ (println "Encoded: " encoded)
        decoded (await
                 (-> (async/Stream.fromIterable encoded)
                     (. #/(cast String))
                     (.transform (.-decoder codec))
                     .toList))
        _ (println "Decoded: " decoded)]))
```

## Default Type Mapping

Coming soon.

## Testing

_NOTE: 2025-06-28 :json-verbose not passing all tests._

To run the roundtrip verification tests in `transit-format`, first ensure
Dart>=2.19.4 and Java 8 are installed, then do the following:

1. Set up a testing directory where `transit-format` and `transit-cljd` can be
   cloned side-by-side. We have a fork `transit-format` that has support for
   testing `transit-cljd` all ready to go. Clone this to your test directory.

```sh
mkdir transit-test
cd transit-test
git clone https://github.com/wevre/transit-format.git
# Do something similar to the following to ensure Java 8.
jenv local 1.8
```

2. From the `transit-format` directory, run the verify command.

```sh
bin/verify -impls cljd
```

_NOTE: The above instructions might not quite work because of incompatibilities
between Java 8 and later versions. ClojureDart has until very recently required
Java 11. You might need to manually compile the 'wevre.roundtrip' namespace in
Java 11, and then run verify with Java 8._

```sh
# Do this in the transit-test directory with Java 11.
git clone git@github.com:wevre/transit-cljd
cd transit-cljd
clj -M:cljd compile wevre.roundtrip
cd ../transit-format
bin/verify -impls cljd
```
