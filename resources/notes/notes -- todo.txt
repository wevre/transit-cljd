:section Reminders

   Compile a specific namespace with `clj -M:cljd compile <ns>`.

   Run a specific file with `dart run <dart-file>`. Note that cljd outputs to
   lib/cljd-out.

:section ToDo

   [] Documentation.

:section Done

   [✓] Test a custom type with custom read/write-handlers.

   [✓] Check out the nums_test file. I can't get an object to decode all the way
   back to dart/clojuredart objects.

   [✓] Get roundtrip testing with transit-format/verify working.

   [✓] ClojureDart maybe has a way to put test files in test/cljd-out? It's
   listed in .gitignore but can't see anything that actually puts stuff in that
   folder. UPDATE I'm going back to an earlier approach where I let the test
   files compile as normal to lib/cljd-out, but then I export them in a .dart
   file under test/. That allows me to run dart test and they get picked up.

   [✓] Organize src and test code under high level 'cljd' directory, with
   appropriate changes to deps.edn.

   [✓] The quick example, put that in a test file.

   [✓] In dart_test.yaml we can set the test directory. And if we make our
   namespaces something_test, the resulting file will be named with an
   underscore, too, so Dart will pick them up as valid tests.
